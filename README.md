# Amharic AI Chatbot on Raspberry Pi

This project demonstrates how to create an Amharic AI chatbot that runs on a Raspberry Pi. It leverages Google Speech-to-Text for transcribing Amharic speech, Anthropic's Claude API for generating Amharic responses, and Google Text-to-Speech for synthesizing the responses into speech.

## Features

- Real-time Amharic speech recognition and transcription
- AI-generated Amharic responses using Anthropic's Claude API
- Text-to-speech synthesis of Amharic responses
- Continuous conversation loop with start/stop controls
- Incremental output file naming for each conversation

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB RAM recommended)
- USB microphone
- Speaker
- Python 3.7+
- Google Cloud SDK
- Anthropic API key
- PyAudio
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amharic-ai-chatbot.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install google-cloud-speech google-cloud-texttospeech anthropic pyaudio pygame
   ```

3. Set up your Google Cloud credentials:
   - Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console
   - Enable the Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs
   - Download the service account key JSON file
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON file

4. Set up your Anthropic API key:
   - Sign up for an Anthropic API key
   - Replace `"your_anthropic_api_key"` in the code with your actual API key

## Usage

1. Connect your USB microphone and speaker to the Raspberry Pi.

2. Run the chatbot script:
   ```
   python chatbot.py
   ```

3. Press 'r' to start recording your Amharic speech. The chatbot will transcribe your speech, generate an Amharic response, and synthesize it into speech.

4. Press 'q' to stop the recording and trigger the response generation process.

5. Press 'e' to exit the chatbot.

The generated audio files will be saved as `output_1.mp3`, `output_2.mp3`, and so on.

## Customization

- Adjust the `system` prompt in the `generate_amharic_response()` function to customize the chatbot's personality and behavior.
- Modify the `voice` and `audio_config` parameters in the `synthesize_amharic_speech()` function to change the voice and audio settings for speech synthesis.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with the USB microphone or speaker, ensure they are properly connected and configured on your Raspberry Pi.
- Check the Google Cloud and Anthropic API credentials and make sure they are set up correctly.
- Verify that you have installed all the required dependencies and have the necessary permissions to access the APIs.

   - Verify that you have Python 3.7 or above by running `python3 --version` in the terminal.

4. **Dependency Installation**
   - Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:
     ```
     pip install google-cloud-speech google-cloud-texttospeech anthropic pyaudio pygame
     ```

5. **Google Cloud Setup**
   - Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Enable the Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs for your project.
   - Create a service account and download the JSON key file.
   - Move the JSON key file to a secure location on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON key file:
     ```
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/keyfile.json"
     ```

6. **Anthropic API Setup**
   - Sign up for an Anthropic API key at https://www.anthropic.com/.
   - Replace `"your_anthropic_api_key"` in the code with your actual API key.

7. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Clone the Amharic AI Chatbot repository by running the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amharic-ai-chatbot.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the cloned repository:
     ```
     cd amharic-ai-chatbot
     ```

8. **Run the Chatbot**
   - Ensure your USB microphone and speaker are connected to the Raspberry Pi.
   - Run the chatbot script using the following command:
     ```
     python chatbot.py
     ```

9. **Interact with the Chatbot**
   - Press 'r' to start recording your Amharic speech.
   - Speak in Amharic, and the chatbot will transcribe your speech.
   - Press 'q' to stop the recording and trigger the response generation process.
   - The chatbot will generate an Amharic response and synthesize it into speech.
   - Press 'e' to exit the chatbot.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and set up the Amharic AI Chatbot on your Raspberry Pi. Enjoy conversing with the chatbot in Amharic!
